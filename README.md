# 2D Physics Simulations

## set up

** If you are viewing this on a macbook retina display, please navigate to where python 3 is install, click the icon, choose get information and select launch in low resolution more. If this is not done, the simulation will run at a low fps

1) Install python3 at "https://www.python.org/downloads/"

2) In terminal or command prompt type in and enter python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user"

3) In terminal or command prompt type in "git clone https://github.com/billzyc/2D-Physics-Simulations.git"

## Fluid (Smoothed-particle hydrodynamics) simulation
### overview
**work in progress**
Fluid simluation using Smoothed-particle hydrodynamics. 
Used help from:

### set up
1) after cloning the repo enter "cd fluid-flow-simulation" in terminal or command prompt
2) enter "python3 main.py" or "python main.py"

## Electrostatics simulation
### overview
**work in progress**
Click anywhere on the grid to place particle and enter value of charge.
Click again on particle to set as target charge and see the electric force on the target charge.

### set up
1) after cloning the repo enter "cd electrostatics-simulation" in terminal or command prompt
2) enter "python3 main.py" or "python main.py"


## Kinematics simulation

### overview
Projectile launch simulation with realistic physics. View the projectile travel and it's arc.
Click anywhere in window to position a projectile and enter the velocity/angle it is launched at.

### set up
1) after cloning the repo enter "cd kinematics-simulation" in terminal or command prompt
2) enter "python3 main.py" or "python main.py"
